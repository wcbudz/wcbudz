# Hey, I'm Walter!

Recently, I was the head of growth operations at Mirascope, an LLM devtools startup, and before that started the growth and BizOps functions at [Tailscale](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/). I've spent a lot of time as a consultant for tech businesses helping develop and bring great products to market. I started this whole trip off as a social sciences freak, with degrees in anthropology and psychoanalysis, and somehow stumbled into product and marketing by way of system administration. 
I learned the deepest of the deep on human motivation from the creators of [Self-Determination Theory](https://selfdeterminationtheory.com) while at [Immersyve](https://immersyve.com) and co-founded [motivationWorks](https://motivationworks.com) while there. Now I get to apply the best of behavioral science to my work, whether creating products or internal greatness for a company.
